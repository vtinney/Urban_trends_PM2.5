# Global urban temporal trends in fine particulate matter and attributable health burdens.

The objective of this analysis is to describe temporal trends (2000 to 2018) in population weighted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and PM2.5-attributable health burdens for ~13,000 global urban centers. 

The following provides the code needed to replicate this analysis with input files provided in the sub-repositories.

All code run in R/3.5.3 and Gdal
